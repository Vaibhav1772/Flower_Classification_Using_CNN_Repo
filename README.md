# Flower Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains a flower classification model implemented using TensorFlow. The model is trained on a large dataset of flower images and can predict the species of a given flower image with high accuracy. The project demonstrates the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.

## Key Features

- Utilizes the TensorFlow library for deep learning tasks
- Implements a CNN architecture for image classification
- Trains the model on a large dataset of flower images
- Provides data preprocessing and augmentation techniques
- Evaluates the model's performance on a separate test dataset
- Includes a trained model for direct usage or further fine-tuning
- Offers a user-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-classification.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the dataset and train the model:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. Use the trained model to make predictions on new flower images:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training this model was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Kaggle is a popular platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts, providing a wide range of datasets for various domains.

### Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains[different types of flower images]. It consists of [10 different species of flowers with a considerate amount of images for each species].

### Accessing the Dataset

To access the dataset, follow these steps:

1. Create an account on Kaggle (if you don't have one already) at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
